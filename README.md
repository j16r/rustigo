# Rustigo

![build and test](https://github.com/j16r/rustigo/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)

This is a simple multiplayer go game, with a rust backend and a websockets based backend.

Players can start a game from the root site, which generates a unique URL. This
URL can be shared with a friend to start a game of Go. The player who initiated
the game is the black player.

This project is currently in development.
